# ExpressProjectSample

This is a simple Express.js project sample designed to understand the basics of building a web server using Express. It provides a minimal starting point for creating RESTful APIs, handling HTTP requests, and structuring Node.js applications. Ideal for beginners and those looking to prototype or extend with custom routes, middleware, and features.

## Features
- Basic Express server setup
- Ready for further development

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher recommended)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Server

```bash
node index.js
```

The server will start on the default port (usually 3000). You can change the port in `index.js` if needed.
